        <h2 id = "chapTitle">Chapter 2 – Going back in time with 500 years of knowledge</h2>
        <p class = "chapterContent">It is said in legend that a river of time exists in this world. It supports the world’s time flow and circulation. And by using the Spring Autumn Cicada’s power, one can travel back upstream and return to the past.</p>
        <p class = "chapterContent">There is much conflicting opinion on this mythical tale. Many do not believe in it, and some are skeptical to the truth.</p>
        <p class = "chapterContent">Few people actually dare to believe it.</p>
        <p class = "chapterContent">Because every time one uses the Spring Autumn Cicada one must pay with his life, letting his entire body and cultivation be the driving force to use its power.</p>
        <p class = "chapterContent">Such a price is just too expensive, and the thing that people just cannot accept is the fact that after paying with your life, you don’t even know what the outcome is.</p>
        <p class = "chapterContent">So even if someone has the Spring Autumn Cicada, they would not dare use it so indiscriminately. What if the rumors were fake, and it was just a scam?</p>
        <p class = "chapterContent">If Fang Yuan were not cornered into such a state, he would also not use it so hurriedly. But now, Fang Yuan is thoroughly convinced. Because the reality of the truth has been laid before his eyes and there was no denying it. He has really been reborn!</p>
        <p class = "chapterContent">“It’s just a pity… From the start I had wasted an absurd amount of effort, killing hundreds of thousands of people, making even the heavens furious and inciting people’s vengeance, went through suffering and multiple hardships to finally attain and refine this good Gu…” Fang Yuan thought with a sigh. Even though he had been reborn, the Spring Autumn Cicada did not come with him.</p>
        <p class = "chapterContent">Humans are the greatest among thousands of creatures, Gu are the essence of heaven and earth.</p>
        <p class = "chapterContent">Gu comes in thousands of shapes and sizes of strange and mysterious variety – there are too many to count. Some Gu after being used once or even twice or thrice will completely dissipate. And some Gu can be reused again and again as long as it is not used over its limits.</p>
        <p class = "chapterContent">That said, it is probable that the Spring Autumn Cicada is one of those types that can only be used once before disappearing for good.</p>
        <p class = "chapterContent">“But even if its gone, I can still refine another. I have done it in my previous life, why can’t I do it in this life?” After the thoughts of pity were put aside, Fang Yuan’s heart burst forth ambitious and determined feelings.</p>
        <p class = "chapterContent">To be able to be reborn, this fact made the loss of the Spring Autumn Cicada entirely acceptable.</p>
        <p class = "chapterContent">Not to mention he had something precious with him, so its not like he lost everything.</p>
        <p class = "chapterContent">This precious treasure was his 500 years worth of memories and experience.</p>
        <p class = "chapterContent">In his memories are a multitude of all kinds of treasures and precious items that no one has opened yet in this time. All the big events and incidents he can easily grasp by the veins of history. There are a countless number of figures: some are predecessors of hidden levels; some are geniuses, some people not even born yet. Also in these 500 years of life are memories of painstaking cultivation and rich combat experience.</p>
        <p class = "chapterContent">With all these memories and experiences, he had undeniably grasped the overall situation and upcoming opportunities. With good planning and execution, he could empower the situation with great fierceness and elegance. It was not a problem now that he could take a step ahead of others, breaking the higher boundaries!</p>
        <p class = "chapterContent">“So how do I go about this hmmm…” Fang Yuan was incredibly sensible. He collected himself together and faced the night rain outside the window, pondering. With this thought, things started to feel complicated. After thinking for a moment, his brows wrinkled deeper.</p>
        <p class = "chapterContent">500 years of time was a rather long period. Don’t mention those long muddled memories that cannot be recalled, even remembering the hidden locations of treasures or special encounters of people were a lot, but the main issue was that the locations were separated among a long distance and had to be accessed or visited at certain periods of time.</p>
        <p class = "chapterContent">“The most important thing is cultivation. The me right now has not even opened my Primeval Sea, hasn’t stepped on the path to be a Gu Master. I’m just a mortal! I have to hurry and cultivate, catching up to history and seize the opportunities with the best advantage.”</p>
        <p class = "chapterContent">Not to forget, many of these hidden locations of treasures were useless without proper foundation. Instead it would just be walking into a wolf’s den, looking for death.</p>
        <p class = "chapterContent">The problem in front of Fang Yuan right now was cultivation.</p>
        <p class = "chapterContent">“To cultivate as fast as possible, I would have to borrow the resources from the clan. With the state I am right now, I have no power or ability to travel back and forth across the dangerous mountains. Even an ordinary mountain boar can take my life. If I can reach the cultivation of a Third level Gu Master, I’d have the means to protect myself and leave the mountain.”</p>
        <p class = "chapterContent">Through the eyes of a 500 year old person who has cultivated in the Demonic Way, Qing Mao Mountain was just way too small, Gu Yue Village even feels like a cage.</p>
        <p class = "chapterContent">But while the cage restricted freedom, the sturdy bars of the cage also brought about a certain kind of safety.</p>
        <p class = "chapterContent">“Hmm, in this short period of time I’ll just stay in this cage. As long as I can reach Third level Gu Master, I can leave this poor mountain. Luckily tomorrow is the Awakening Ceremony, I’ll be able to start training as a Gu Master soon after.”</p>
        <p class = "chapterContent">When he thought about the Awakening Ceremony, old memories that had long been buried away in his heart resurfaced themselves.</p>
        <p class = "chapterContent">“Talent huh…” He sneered, his gaze focused out the window.</p>
        <p class = "chapterContent">At this moment, the door to his room was lightly pushed open and a young teenager walked in.</p>
        <p class = "chapterContent">“Big brother, why are you standing in the rain by the window side?"</p>
        <p class = "chapterContent">The youth was thin, slightly shorter than Fang Yuan. His face resembled Fang Yuan’s features greatly. As Fang Yuan turned his head to look at this young man, a complicated look flickered across his face.</p>
